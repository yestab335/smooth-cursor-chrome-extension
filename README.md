## How does it work?
Some websites use custom rendering engines to edit rich text, instead of relying on `contenteditable` or using a plain `<textarea>`/`<input>`. When using such custom methods, the cursor is not the native one, and is instead an HTML element, that can be stylized like any other. For example, Google Docs uses a 2-pixels-wide div with a black background to render its cursor.

Since those cursors are plain in HTML elements, they can be **stylized**, that's where this extension comes in.

The process is simple:

1. Find the element
2. Append `transition: all 310ms` to its style tag

The problem with this is that methods using the native cursor can't really have them applied: I _can't_ access the system cursor to style it with CSS.
